## 🏗 Technical Scope

The work involved designing and maintaining:

* Data validation pipelines
* Structured SQL-based transformation workflows
* Data quality checks and anomaly detection logic
* Reporting data models
* Dashboard-backed monitoring systems

The environment required high data accuracy, traceability, and reproducibility.

## 🔄 Data Workflow Architecture

### 1️⃣ Data Ingestion

* Imported structured biomass datasets from reporting entities
* Standardized formats across multiple submission structures
* Normalized data schemas for consistency

### 2️⃣ Data Validation & Quality Control

* Implemented rule-based validation logic
* Checked completeness, consistency, and referential integrity
* Validated sustainability criteria thresholds
* Identified outliers in reported GHG emission values
* Flagged non-compliant entries for review

### 3️⃣ Transformation & Aggregation

* Built SQL transformation queries for:

  * Emissions aggregation
  * Supply chain traceability checks
  * Compliance metric calculation
* Structured reusable query logic for recurring reporting cycles
* Optimized queries for performance and maintainability

### 4️⃣ Reporting Output Layer

* Generated structured outputs aligned with EU regulatory templates
* Ensured reproducible reporting processes
* Maintained documentation of transformation logic
* Supported audit readiness through traceable data lineage
